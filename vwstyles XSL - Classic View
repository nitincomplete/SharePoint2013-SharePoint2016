Issue: 
  SharePoint fields like Title, Created and Modified are not showing data correctly after changing from Modern to classic.
Analysis: 
  vwstyles.xsl was missing from C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\16\layouts could be the issue
Resolution:
  replaced vsstyles.xsl and the issue seems to have resolved
